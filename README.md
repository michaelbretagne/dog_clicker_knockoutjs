# dog-clicker_knockoutjs

This is basically the same dog-clicker app I created previously
but I am using the Knowckout web framework instead of the Model-View-Octopus pattern.<br>
**Knockout** is a standalone **JavaScript** implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://github.com/michaelbretagne/dog_clicker) pattern with templates.

This app is a part of Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course.
