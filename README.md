# dog-clicker_knockoutjs

This is basically the same [dog-clicker app](https://github.com/michaelbretagne/dog_clicker) that I previously created but I am using the Knockout web framework instead of the [Model-View-Octopus](https://github.com/michaelbretagne/dog_clicker) pattern.<br>
**Knockout** is a standalone **JavaScript** implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel pattern with templates.

This app is a part of Udacity's Javascript Design Patterns course.
